# YAIE.js
Yet another image encrypter implemented in JavaScript

## Warning
YAIE.js performs simple and **weak** encryption! **DO NOT USE FOR SERIOUS PURPOSE!**

## Specification
YAIE simply divides image into parts and rotate every part upside down which would likely make the image hard to recognize. Therefore, YAIE does better with images that are big and complex and may be less effective when dealing with small or simple images.
YAIE only runs on your device, locally and offline, always.
